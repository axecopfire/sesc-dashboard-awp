# Southeast Startup Challenge

## The challenge
The Southeast Startup Challenge is a 48-hour hackathon funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton and Red Bull and is FREE TO REGISTER! There are cash prizes for winners and an opportunity for winners to pitch to a statewide public health summit in Athens, Ga in June 2018!

Challenges have been created with local partner organizations for the Augusta location of this state wide hackathon happening in March. 
#### Here is the gist of each one:

  Develop a responsive website (and app) to improve the ability of organizations like the Augusta Warrior Project to connect their community with economic and wellness resources, a method for revenue generation (connection with donors and corporate partners), and digital profiles (social media, etcâ€¦).
